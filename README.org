Helm-pass is a [[https://emacs-helm.github.io/helm/][helm]] interface for [[https://www.passwordstore.org/][pass]], the standard unix password
manager. 

* Installation

You may clone =helm-pass= from its git repository, or install it from MELPA. To
load it, assuming you use the excellent [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] package, it is as simple as:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package helm-pass)
#+END_SRC

* Usage
  
The main command is ~helm-pass~ which will list all the passwords that
=pass= knows about and allow you to perform various commands on them.
The default (i.e. just pressing =RET=) will copy the password to your
clipboard. 

* Pass in Emacs
Users of helm-pass may also be interested in functionality provided by other Emacs packages dealing with pass:

- pass.el (a major mode for pass): https://github.com/NicolasPetton/pass
- auth-password-store.el (integration of Emacs' auth-source with pass): https://github.com/DamienCassou/auth-password-store
- ivy-pass.el, for users of ivy [[https://github.com/ecraven/ivy-pass]]
