Helm-pass is a [[https://emacs-helm.github.io/helm/][helm]] interface for [[https://www.passwordstore.org/][pass]], the standard unix password
manager. 

* Installation

  =helm-pass= is available on MELPA. Assuming you use the excellent
  [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] package (and have MELPA set up), you may install and use
  it with the following:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (use-package helm-pass
      :ensure t
      :commands (helm-pass))
  #+END_SRC

* Usage
  
  The main command is ~helm-pass~ which will list all the passwords that
  =pass= knows about and allow you to perform various commands on them.
  The default (i.e. just pressing =RET=) will copy the password to your
  clipboard. 

* Todo list
** TODO copy username
** TODO git pull/push
